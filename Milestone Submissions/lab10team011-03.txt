Application Name: Cool Kids Book Application

Application Description: Our application will allow you to create a user that will
keep track of all of your reading neads. You will be able to make a profile that will keep track of previous books read
and the user's favorite genre. You then will be able to find different people/matches who have simlar likes and add 
them to your friend list. Another part of the application is the recommendation tab that will give you new books
to read based off your profile and matches.

Another functionality of our application is showing reviews and being able to make your own review on 
the books in the api. You will also be able to make a wishlist where you put different books that you 
would like to read in the future. 


Vision Statement: To introduce people to new books and friends who have similar interests.
