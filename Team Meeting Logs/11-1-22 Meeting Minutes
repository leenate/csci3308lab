11-1-22 Meeting Minutes:

1st team meeting with TA.

Discussed how the meetings will proceed. Each week we will cover:
  1. Progress made since the last week, including which members did what tasks.
  2. Plans for the next week.
  3. Any potential blockers or dependencies preventing us from making progress.
 
 The team showed our project board, and discussed our project idea. 
 We also walked through adding a user story to the project board.
 
 The team indicated that we would have our user stories and epics on the project board completed by the end of this week.
 Next week, we will move on to getting started on coding our assigned to-dos (visible on the project board).
