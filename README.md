Application Description: <br />
Finding books to read and like-minded friends to discuss books with can be difficult. Our group has created a solution: an application that lets you find friends and book recommendations based on mutual interests. The Cool Kids Book Application is the ultimate app to connect with other readers, read and write reviews, and find new book recommendations. This application utilizes the Google Books API to give users the information they want in a seamless, visually appealing way, in addition to benefits of a social networking platform. Once users register and log in, they can read and submit book reviews, match with other users who have similar interests, search for books, and add books to their liked books list. Users can also find more information on books they discover through the corresponding Google Books link via the search feature. Another useful feature is the ability to create a wishlist of books that the user would like to read in the future. Users can log out and have their reviews, wishlist, liked books, and other information retained. The Cool Kids Book Application lets you keep track of all of your reading needs while connecting you with others!
